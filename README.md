# art_restoration_vae
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are deep learning models designed to generate variations of the data they were trained on. The encoder maps the input data to a continuous probabilistic representation in the latent space, enabling new variations to be sampled and reconstructed. 
In this academic project, me and my team trained a Variational Autoencoder to restore damaged art images. 
Since it is almost impossible to reconstruct the exact same image subpart, a VAE is a great solution to oppose uncertainty and construct a variant image subsection, extremely similar to the damaged one.
