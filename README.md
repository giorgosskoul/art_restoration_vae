# art_restoration_vae
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are deep learning models designed to generate variations of the data they were trained on. The encoder maps the input data to a continuous probabilistic representation in the latent space, enabling new variations to be sampled and reconstructed. In this academic project, me and my team trained a Variational Autoencoder to restore damaged art images.
